                    if you can see it and feel it 
                    that means you are living a beautiful life!!
                    The best part of nature are kids. Their innocence and innovations
                    makes us feel there is still a reason this universe exists.

                    A kid who is cherished at home becomes an exceptional individual 
                    who is loving and compasionate and the world now needs more of them.
                
                    Kids need your time and love more than the material things in today's world.
                    There are a lot of things you can do with kids at home and outside to spend 
                    quality time with them along with teaching them life skills.

                    There's no need to pretend that teaching a child how to cook is an easy task unless you're a culinary instructor that does it for a living. 
                    It takes patience to teach a kid how to use a knife safely, how to wash fruits and vegetables properly, and how to follow a recipe without taking any shortcuts.
                    However, the time invested in teaching your children how to cook is time well-spent. 
                    It not only provides you with quiet moments to bond with your youngster but also offers myriad other benefits, including boosting confidence, teaching math and science, and imparts wisdom on other cultures.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Cooking together provides quality family time: Cooking time is a bonding time for parent and child. It often allows kids to relax and share what's going on in their lives, 
                    even if they're otherwise reticent to open up to a parent.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Preparing food helps kids appreciate parents: It might seem sometimes that kids think meals come out of nowhere. 
                    Teaching a child how to cook helps them understand how much time and effort it takes for a parent to make a healthy, tasty meal for the family.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Cooking expands their palates: When a child cooks a new food or dish on their own. they are more likely to eat it or at least try it. 
                    They may not eat all of it. They may not eat any of it the first time you make it together. Over time, though, kids will get comfortable with the idea of new foods and, eventually, they will start to try them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Making a meal boosts confidence: When kids can say, "I made it myself," they feel a sense of accomplishment. 
                    Even more, when other family members say they liked what the child cooked, he or she feels a sense of pride and achievement. That can lead to the child becoming more self-confident in other areas of their life, too.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Following a recipe teaches math: Cooking teaches kids everything from fractions to temperatures to geometry. 
                    Is a 1/2 cup bigger than 1/4 cup? What's the difference between the temperature of baking versus broiling? What's a 9x13 pan versus a 9x9 pan?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Understanding a recipe improves reading comprehension: Cooking is one of the best ways to show kids that reading offers tangible results. 
                    Following step-by-step instructions to get to a finished result is an important reading skill, and using that skill to cook shows a kid that reading has very practical benefits.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The process of cooking food demonstrates chemistry principles: Take, for example, the browning of marshmallows on top of brownies it's chemistry at a level that a child can understand.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Grocery shopping communicates where food comes from: Part of cooking is shopping. When you cook together, kids learn that pizza doesn't have to come from a restaurant and spaghetti sauce doesn't have to come from a jar. 
                    One of the easiest and most enjoyable things to cook with kids is bread. Many kids think bread is a raw ingredient, but just showing them that they can make bread in their own homes is a revelation 
                    You don't even have to make it by hand. The act of adding ingredients to a bread machine and getting a loaf of delicious warm bread three hours later is enough to make an impression.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Choosing recipes educates on culture: It is far more interesting to teach kids about the Chinese New Year by making an authentic recipe than by giving them a history lesson.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Cooking imparts a basic but important life skill: When the kids are out of the house, you won't need to worry about them as much if you're sure they know how to cook. 
                    Their budget won't be hit as hard by constant take-out meals, and you will be fairly certain that they're not living on a diet

                    Plant treats to eat. Regular strawberries or alpine strawberries, for example, make an easy landscaping plant and delicious snacks. 
                    And they grow back every year. Blueberries make a nice landscape bush. Of course, there are fruit trees, too. The idea is to teach kids to snack from your yard.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Let them plant vegetables and flowers in containers right by their favorite place to play. Plant carrots in a pot by the swing set or cherry tomatoes next to the slide. 
                    Or just grow some green beans by the back door. Never eaten a fresh raw green bean? You haven't lived!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Create places to snuggle outside. Sitting in a comfy chair snuggling with your kids is the best positive reinforcement you can give. 
                    An added bonus is when you spot a hummingbird, a butterfly, or a cute rabbit while you're there.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Make secret hideouts. When my oldest was young, she and her cousin had "the digging yard," which was a patch of dirt under the branches of an ancient forsythia bush where they took digging trucks 
                    and basically just dug things. Endless hours of fun!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Look for scat. We have a fox that loves to mark its territory by pooping right in the middle of the driveway. What kid doesn't love to talk about poop? 
                    Every kid should know the difference between deer poop and rabbit poop and other kinds of poop. The wild animal poop list is endless and endlessly fascinating.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Don't show fear. Find a worm? Ohh and ahh don't screech. Spiders? Cool! "Let's look up what kind it is" Kids walk in covered in mud? Don't freak out. 
                    Laugh about it and make them do their own laundry. Clothes are totally replaceable. Kids and nature are not.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Gather treasures. Sticks, flowers, stones, dead bugs, grass clippings, moss, feathers, weird unidentified objects it's all good! Encourage the kids to make a special box to keep them in.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Look up bird sounds and birds to identify together. There's one bird that always sounds like it's singing "drink your teeeeeeaaaaa" all summer. 
                    And another that sounds like a wild monkey that one is a pileated woodpecker, which is as big as a small monkey!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Paint it, draw it, photograph it. Put an easel outside and let them get messy and create. Give the kids the camera and see the world through their eyes. Give them a sketchbook and some colored pencils, 
                    put on some music, and don't criticize or overdirect. When it comes to creativity, there is no right or wrong or good or bad. That's the way it is with nature, too.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A blanket, some pillows, a picnic, and some tea. It's the quintessential thing to do, but don't skimp on comfort or the tea. 
                    If you have fresh mint or fresh lemon verbena, just pour some boiling water over it. Or make homemade lemonade. The idea is to get comfortable, relax, and enjoy spending time outside with your kids no matter what their age! 
                    After all, nature is timeless and brings out the kid in all of us.

                        Reading should not be presented to children as a chore or duty.  It should be offered to them as a precious gift.
                        Whenever you read a good book, somewhere in the world a door opens to allow in more light.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It is not enough to simply teach children to read, we have to give them something worth reading. 
                        Something that will stretch their imaginations, something that will help them make sense of their own lives and 
                        encourage them to reach out toward people whose lives are quite different from their own.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Reading teaches people how to think. I want my kids to be thinkers.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Reading opens up worlds, experiences, and insights into a kid's life that they could never experience otherwise.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If a child can learn to love books, they will never be bored.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Literacy is one of the best way to combat ignorance. I want my kids to not only not be ignorant, but to be open minded and thoughtful. Reading will help accomplish that.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I want my kids to be able to not just survive, but to thrive in our ever changing, ultra-competitive world. If they aren't highly-literate, creative & critical thinkers, 
                        they don't stand much of a chance. Reading will give them a leg up.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Knowing how to read a book is kind of like knowing how to read people, places, situations. If you can read a text, thoughtfully as well as critically, 
                        you are much better equipped to deal with complex interpersonal situations & real world dilemmas.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Reading in childhood is not the same as reading as an adult. There's something magical about reading books as a kid, before the loss of innocence sets in (adolescence).
                        I want my kids to experience the magic of reading while yet (relatively) unscathed by the world.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In an age of quick sound bites & snippets of information, I want my kids to learn the satisfaction of reading long, uninterrupted texts.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Good readers = good writers. Good writers = good communicators. Good communicators = successful people. Therefore, good readers = successful people.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There is joy in reading just to read. That has so much value just on its own.
