                <p>The beauty of life lies in nature, 
                        if you can see it and feel it 
                        that means you are living a beautiful life!!
                        </p>
                <p>The best part of nature are kids. Their innocence and innovations
                        makes us feel there is still a reason this universe exists.

                <p>If you want a better world it all starts at home.
                    A kid who is cherished at home becomes an exceptional individual 
                    who is loving and compasionate and the world now needs more of them.
                         </p>
                <p>Kids need your time and love more than the material things in today's world.
                    There are a lot of things you can do with kids at home and outside to spend 
                    quality time with them along with teaching them life skills.

                <p> <h2>First : Teaching to cook</h2>
                    I think children learning to cook can be such a wonderful thing.It can help build confidence,make them feel good about themselves.
                    Cooking is also a way to teach kids to read and do math. A chef is a very resposible person.He needs to think like a Scientist, 
                    organise like an accountant,plate like an Artist and cook like a Grandma.Cooking with kids is not just about ingredients,
                    recipes and cooking. It's about harnessing imagination,empowerment and creativity.

                <p> <h2>Second : Teaching to appreciate nature</h2>
                In order for your life to be great,you must first learn to appreciate it. A child, more than anyone else is a spontaneous observer of nature.
                Unless we are willing to encourage our children to reconnect with and appreciate the natural world,
                 We cannot expect them to help protect and care for it.

                <p><h2>Third : Teaching them to love reading</h2>
                Reading should not be presented to children as a chore or duty.  It should be offered to them as a precious gift.
                Whenever you read a good book, somewhere in the world a door opens to allow in more light.
                It is not enough to simply teach children to read, we have to give them something worth reading. 
                Something that will stretch their imaginations, something that will help them make sense of their own lives and encourage them to reach out toward people whose lives are quite different from their own.
                Any book that helps a child to form a habit of reading, to make reading one of his needs, is good for him.
                There is no such thing as a child who hates to read, there are only children who have not found the right book.
                You may have tangible wealth untold, caskets of jewels and coffers of gold. Richer than I you can never be. I had a mother who read to me.
